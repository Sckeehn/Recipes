- 1/3 cup all-purpose flour 
- 1 1/4 teaspoons salt

- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 
- 1/2 cup white wine 
- 3/4 cup chicken broth 
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice 
- salt and pepper, to taste 
- 2 tablespoons chopped parsley

## Directions
1. For the chicken: Place each piece of chicken in between two pieces of plastic wrap. Pound the chicken to create thin cutlets.
2. Place the flour, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Mix them until combined.
3. Place the eggs and milk in a small bowl and whisk them until smooth.
4. Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat.
5. Dredge each chicken cutlet in the flour mixture, then dip each one in the egg.
6. Place the chicken breasts in a single layer in the pan.
7. Cook them for 4 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through.
8. Remove the chicken from the pan and cover it to keep it warm. Wipe out the pan with a paper towel.
9. For the sauce: Heat 1 tablespoon of butter in the pan over medium heat. Add the lemon slices. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until the lemon slices have browned. Remove the lemon slices from the pan.
10. Add the rest of the butter to the pan, and cook it until melted. Add the flour and cook it for one minute, stirring constantly.
11. Pour in the white wine and let it simmer for 2 minutes. Add the chicken broth and let it simmer for an additional 4-5 minutes or until the sauce has just thickened.
12. Stir in the lemon juice and season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.
13. Return the chicken to the pan. Spoon the sauce over the chicken, then top it with cooked lemon slices. Sprinkle it with parsley, then serve the chicken immediately.
